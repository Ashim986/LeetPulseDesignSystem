## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Update in-place rather than restructure — minimize disruption, fix what's broken first
- [Init]: Keep markdown format — already established, works well for GitHub rendering

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Repository URL accuracy — README currently references `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow`; verify correct GitHub URL before publishing updated README
- [Phase 1]: DSTheme full initializer signature needs verification from DSTheme.swift before writing theme section
- [Phase 3]: DSText and DSTextValidation access level — confirm `public` modifier before including in catalog; may be internal helpers
