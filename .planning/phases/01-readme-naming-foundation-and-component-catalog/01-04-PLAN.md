<objective>
Close the two verification gaps from Phase 1 without re-implementing completed work.

Gap 1: CATL-02 text and ROADMAP.md Success Criterion 3 conflict with the user's locked decision in CONTEXT.md. The user explicitly decided against a separate Mobile-specific group, choosing inline labeling in the Platform column instead. The requirement text was never updated to match. This plan formally records the accepted approach in both REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md so future verifications do not re-flag a resolved decision as a gap.

Gap 2: README.md SPM installation block uses `https://github.com/Ashim986/LeetPulseDesignSystem` (a URL that does not exist as a git remote). The actual git remote is `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow.git`. Any developer copying the SPM block from README would target the wrong repository. This plan corrects the URL to match the actual remote.

Purpose: Make the verification record match reality — the user's CONTEXT.md decision governs CATL-02, and the SPM URL must be accurate.
Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md (CATL-02), updated ROADMAP.md (Success Criterion 3), corrected README.md (SPM URL two occurrences).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update CATL-02 and Success Criterion 3 to reflect inline-labeling decision</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
The user locked this decision in CONTEXT.md: "No separate Mobile-specific group — mobile components integrated into their functional group with an inline (iOS/iPadOS) badge." The CATL-02 requirement text and ROADMAP.md Success Criterion 3 still describe the alternative (a separate group), causing false verification failures.

In `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`:
- Find the CATL-02 line (currently: "Components organized into logical groups: Primitives, Form Controls, Navigation, Feedback, Visualization, Mobile-specific")
- Replace with: "Components organized into logical groups: Primitives, Form Controls, Navigation, Feedback, Visualization — with mobile-specific components labeled inline (iOS/iPadOS) in the Platform column within their functional group"
- Mark the checkbox [x] if not already marked (it currently is marked [x] per the file — preserve that)
- Also update the Traceability table row for CATL-02 — keep Status as "Complete" (it is complete per the implemented approach)

In `.planning/ROADMAP.md`:
- Find Phase 1 Success Criteria item 3 (currently: "Mobile-specific components are grouped separately and labeled iOS/iPadOS-only so a developer knows immediately they cannot use them on macOS")
- Replace with: "Mobile-specific components are labeled iOS/iPadOS-only inline in the Platform column of their functional group, so a developer reading any group row knows immediately whether the component is mobile-only"

Do not modify any other content in either file.

    Run: grep -n "inline" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
    Expected: CATL-02 line now contains "inline" and "Platform column"

    Run: grep -n "inline" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/ROADMAP.md
    Expected: Success Criterion 3 now contains "inline" describing the labeling approach

  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md CATL-02 and ROADMAP.md Success Criterion 3 both describe the inline Platform-column labeling approach. Neither document references "grouped separately" for mobile components. The [x] on CATL-02 in REQUIREMENTS.md is preserved.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Correct SPM repository URL in README.md to match git remote</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
The README contains two occurrences of the non-existent URL `https://github.com/Ashim986/LeetPulseDesignSystem`. The actual git remote (confirmed by `git remote -v`) is `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow.git`.

In `README.md`:
- Find and replace ALL occurrences of `https://github.com/Ashim986/LeetPulseDesignSystem` with `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow`
  - Line 6 (repository link in prose or header context)
  - Line 14 (`.package(url:` line in the SPM code block)
  - Note: Use the URL without `.git` suffix in prose/badge contexts; the `.package(url:)` call may use the URL with or without `.git` — match whatever form is already in the file and replace only the host path portion `Ashim986/LeetPulseDesignSystem` with `Ashim986/DSFocusFlow`

Do not change any other content. Do not modify platform targets (iOS 26+, macOS 14+ — already correct).

    Run: grep -n "DSFocusFlow" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/README.md

  </verify>
  <done>README.md SPM installation block `.package(url:)` uses `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow` matching the actual git remote. All prior LeetPulseDesignSystem github.com URL references replaced. FocusDesignSystem count remains 0.</done>

After both tasks complete:

1. `grep -n "inline" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — shows updated CATL-02 with inline labeling description
2. `grep -n "inline" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/ROADMAP.md` — shows updated Success Criterion 3
3. `grep -c "grouped separately" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — returns 0
4. `grep -c "grouped separately" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/.planning/ROADMAP.md` — returns 0
5. `grep "github.com" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/README.md | grep -c "LeetPulseDesignSystem"` — returns 0
6. `grep -c "DSFocusFlow" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/README.md` — returns 2 or more (both URL occurrences corrected)
7. `grep -c "FocusDesignSystem" /Users/ashimdahal/Documents/LeetPulseDesignSystem/README.md` — returns 0 (no regressions)

<success_criteria>
- CATL-02 in REQUIREMENTS.md accurately describes the accepted implementation: inline iOS/iPadOS labeling within functional groups
- Success Criterion 3 in ROADMAP.md matches the CONTEXT.md locked decision and the actual README implementation
- README.md SPM block uses `https://github.com/Ashim986/DSFocusFlow` — a URL that resolves to the actual codebase
- Zero FocusDesignSystem regressions in README.md
- Phase 1 verification gaps (CATL-02 grouping, NAME-04 URL) are closed
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-readme-naming-foundation-and-component-catalog/01-04-SUMMARY.md`
